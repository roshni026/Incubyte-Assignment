# Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft: Galactic Space Craft Control

Welcome to the Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft Galactic Space Craft Control project. This project simulates the control of a spacecraft navigating through the galaxy using galactic coordinates. The spacecraft can be instructed using a set of commands to move and change its direction.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the main.py script to interact with the spacecraft control system.

1. Enter a sequence of commands to control the spacecraft's movement and direction.

1. The program will display the starting position, initial direction, final position, and final direction of the spacecraft based on the executed commands.

## Commands

The following commands can be used to control the spacecraft:

- f: Move the spacecraft forward.
- b: Move the spacecraft backward.
- l: Turn the spacecraft left.
- r: Turn the spacecraft right.
- u: Tilt the spacecraft up.
- d: Tilt the spacecraft down.
